= Introduction =

BIF is a small C++ foundation library, original made to provide cross platform between Win32, Win16 and OS/2 presentation manager. Well, times have changed, but Win32 still remains as the base for Microsofts windows platforms, and so that part of BIF will remain.

This is not a new MFC og otherwise big foundation, but it is a library for the developer that likes to use C++ for a win32 application, but without the overhead of MFC or other "fat" foundations.

The other thing BIF (uwinf) could be, is a platform for Win32 development in linux and Wine. For that reason the first compiler this project will be build for for is MingW, and compatibility with wine 1.0 will be important.

For anyone that need a starting point for low overhead C++ / Win32 app, please fell free to use this as either a base or just inspiration !
