SORT - sorting algorithm demonstration program

This program demonstrates six different sortingalgorithms

Because the painting is different in Windows and PM two versions of the main
module is given.
For Windows your project should include these 3 files:
  winsort.cpp
  sortmoni.cpp
  sortutil.cpp
For PM your project should include these 3 files:
  pmsort.cpp
  sortmoni.cpp
  sortutil.cpp

The rest of the .CPP should not be included in your project since they contain
the implementation of the templates. These files are included by
pmsort.cpp/winsort.cpp.
