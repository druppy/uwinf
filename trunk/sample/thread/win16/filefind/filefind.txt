This demonstration program features a multithreaded filefinder. The
user can perform several searches simultaneously.

The main thread creates a window (actually a dialog), that allows the
user to type in wildcards and a drive letter. The user can then press
the "start" button to start the search.

When the start button is pressed the dialog will create a search
window.

The search window will create a thread to do the filefinding.

The filefind thread will post a message to the search window when it
thinks it is time to update the listbox.

BTW, try comparing the search time of this filefinder with the search
time of your favorite filefinder. The multitasking overhead is
actually quite low.
