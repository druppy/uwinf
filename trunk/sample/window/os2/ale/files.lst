ALE - ArtLink Editor

The IPF compiler supports artlinks, that is bitmaps/metafiles with links in
them. However, it can be a tedious job to put the links at the right
positions because you have to specify the links in the text.

The links are read and written from a .DAT file with the same base
name as the .BMP file. Eg test.bmp and test.dat. This can be used when
creating bitmaps with links in them for the IPF compiler

ALE lets the user load a bitmap from a file and display it. The user can then
create links using the mouse and/or the keyboard.


The user interface is pretty intuitive so an explanation is not given here.
