DEFAULT ARGUMENT FILE
You can put default arguments into a file called 'wr2or.dfl'


NOTES
 - You still have to convert windows bitmaps/icons/cursors into OS/2 format.
   - Mike Robert has made at utility to convert bitmaps. I found it under the
     name 'cvbmp.arj'.
   - Ron Hall has made a program that converts bitmaps, icons and cursor into
     OS/2 format. I found it under the name 'winicon.zip'
 - RCDATA is not supported yet.
 - Inline bitmaps/icons/cursors created by Resource Workshop are supported.
   Note that cursors are dumped to a .CUR file, but the resource script will
   refer to a .PTR file.
 - Concatenated strings are not supported
 - Comments are not supported inside resource definitions
 - Both BEGIN/END and brace blocks are supported.
 - SUBMENU are required to have ids in OS/2 resource scripts. So submenu
   ids are automatically generated starting from 9000
 - Dialogs:
   - Dialog menus are ignored.
   - Dialog classes are ignored.
   - The dialog style translation is not perfect. You have to load the dialogs
     into the OS/2 dialog editor to ensure the translation worked.
   - If the font has been changed you have to change the height of the
     editfields. They seem to be too tall.
   - IDOK and IDCANCEL are translated into DID_OK and DID_CANCEL. All other
     IDxxxx's are not translated.
   - Static rectangle/frame translation is not perfect...
   - Scrollbars are translated into slider controls.
   - CTLDATA statement is not supported yet.
